                <dt>Q: How much will this cost me?</dt>
                <dd><b>A:</b> Finding a therapist is the first step in taking charge of your mental health. This facility aims to care for all patients regardless of economic background and believes that financial obligations should not get in the way of getting the care you need. We work with many insurance providers to help aid with treatment costs, as well as a sliding fee scale.</dd>

            <p>Q: How can I pay my bill?</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Online through the website</li>
                <li>In person, by mail, or by email</li>
                <li>Over the phone if you have a payment method in our records. <a href="tel:763-867-5309">(763) 867-5309</a></li>

            <dl>
                <dt>Q: How do I make further appointments? And what if I need to Cancel?</dt>
                <dd><b>A:</b> Currently our website does not support online appointments. In the future you will be able to log onto your online account to access your appointments. Until these features are added, you will have to call <a href="tel:763-867-5309">(763) 867-5309</a> Monday through Friday, 7:00 am to 7:00 pm for any cancellations.</dd>

                <dt>Q: I am in a crisis what should I do</dt>
                <dd><b>A:</b> Our clinics hours are Monday – Friday, from 7am – 7pm. If you feel you are in crisis and need help between these hours you may contact our psychiatric assistant at (763) 321-7654 to get advisement from a provider. Otherwise please visit our <a href="mh_prevention.html">resources page</a> for immediate help</dd>
                <dt>Q: What should I bring to an appointment?</dt>
                <dd><b>A:</b> For your first appointment we will need your insurance card, photo ID, and your phone or planner to schedule out further appointments. For all other appointments you should just bring your phone or planner and update us on any changes regarding billing.</dd>
                <dt>Q: How long are sessions?</dt>
                <dd><b>A:</b> Expect for your first session to be about an hour and a half to gather all necessary information, and the following appointments to be an hour. Our group sessions are always scheduled to last one hour. All outreach groups last 45 minutes on average with time at the end for private questions.</dd>
