All of our practitioners are trained to treat concerns such as  adjustment disorders, depression, and anxiety. We also have psychologists who specialize in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), postpartum depression (PPD), complicated grief, eating disorders, substance abuse, and couples or family counseling.</p>
            <p><b>Substance abuse-</b> This facility provides a 8 to 12-week intensive outpatient program (OTP) that provides the needed services and support such as a 12-step program. This OTP still allows individuals to live life and carry out responsibilities such as going to work or school. </p>
            <div class="servicePic"><img src="group2.jpg" alt="group" /></div>
            <p><b>Group counseling-</b> While it may be easy to numb out our feelings, or isolate when suffering from an invisible illness, this tends to produce feelings of being alone in life. Hearing a "me too." from a peer can beextremely supportive and facilitate healing. There is strength in numbers, monthly or weekly group therapy sessions are covered on a variety of topics and age groups from adolescent (12-17) to adult.</p>
            <p><b>Outreach and Community-</b> Mental Health mission is to provide mental health services to all, and we offer a variety of outreach services to the community. Click <a href="mh_ab_events.html">here</a> to find out more.</p>
